## ðŸ“š Overview
A repo containing all of the utility scripts I've made for Archean with XenonCode. They mostly follow OOP.

For linting, etc, you'll need [this](https://github.com/batcholi/XenonCode/raw/master/build/xenoncode.exe). More information can be found at the XenonCode [docs](https://wiki.archean.space/xenoncode/documentation.html#testing-xenoncode).
